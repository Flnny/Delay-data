# ![img.png](img.png)Delay_data: Code for Aeolus

- This repository provides the full experimental pipeline for building benchmark datasets from the ‚ÄúAeolus: A Multi‚Äëstructural Flight Delay Dataset‚Äù (available on Kaggle: [mfdd‚Äëmulti‚Äëmodal‚Äëflight‚Äëdelay‚Äëdataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flnny123/mfddmulti-modal-flight-delay-dataset)). It demonstrates how to construct the tabular and graph-based datasets from Aeolus, run multimodal baselines, and visualize delay patterns. You can reproduce experiments across modalities and methodologies, and explore visualizations that help analyze and understand flight delay dynamics.

### SHAP Summary Plot
- The SHAP summary beeswarm plot illustrates how the top‚Äë15 features influence model predictions‚Äîeach point shows an instance‚Äôs feature value and its positive or negative contribution (SHAP value) to delay prediction, with color encoding feature magnitude and horizontal position indicating impact on output

### Delay propagation visualization in Flight Chains

![Delay propagation visualization](util/figures/delay_visual/delay_propagation_chain.png)
- The delay propagation visualization plots a flight chain across hub airports‚Äîwith color‚Äëcoded lines showing average arrival delays‚Äîhighlighting how an upstream delay travels through connections to downstream locations.
### Delay propagation visualization in Flight Networks
- The delay propagation visualization highlights how average arrival delays flow through connected airports in the flight network‚Äîedges colored by delay indicate how upstream disruptions spread across routes in the airport graph.

## üöß Limitations & Future Work

- Lacking fine-grained operational signals such as real‚Äëtime ATC interventions, crew rotation, or passenger itineraries  
- Strong geographic bias: ~78% of flights originate in North America; limited coverage for regional hubs in Africa or South Asia  
- Large scale and multimodal nature may impose high computational requirements; reproducibility supported via full configuration scripts, with lightweight subsets planned
